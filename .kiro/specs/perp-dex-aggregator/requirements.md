# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A perpetual futures DEX aggregator that provides real-time price feeds and order routing across Hyperliquid and Lighter DEX protocols. The system will offer users the best prices and liquidity by aggregating data from these two sources and providing a unified trading interface. Initial version focuses on price aggregation and basic trading functionality without wallet integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Market Data Aggregation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see real-time aggregated prices from multiple perp DEXs, so that I can identify the best trading opportunities across protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish WebSocket connections to Hyperliquid and Lighter DEX
2. WHEN price data is received from either DEX THEN the system SHALL update the aggregated price feed within 100ms
3. WHEN a DEX connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection every 5 seconds with exponential backoff
4. WHEN both DEXs provide prices for the same asset THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the best bid/ask prices
5. IF a DEX has been disconnected for more than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL exclude it from price aggregation and show a warning

### Requirement 2: Basic API Authentication (Placeholder)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic API authentication in place for future wallet integration, so that the system is prepared for user management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL have placeholder authentication middleware ready
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL accept requests without authentication for now
3. WHEN implementing future wallet features THEN the system SHALL have authentication hooks in place
4. WHEN accessing trading endpoints THEN the system SHALL log requests for future user tracking
5. IF authentication is needed later THEN the system SHALL have the framework ready for implementation

### Requirement 3: Order Routing and Trade Execution

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to automatically route my orders to the DEX with the best price and liquidity, so that I get optimal trade execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trade request is made THEN the system SHALL calculate the best route between Hyperliquid and Lighter within 200ms
2. WHEN routing is calculated THEN the system SHALL consider price, slippage, and available liquidity
3. WHEN an order is submitted THEN the system SHALL simulate execution on the selected DEX and provide status updates
4. WHEN a trade simulation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt the alternative DEX automatically
5. IF both DEXs fail THEN the system SHALL return error details and suggested actions

### Requirement 4: Position Management and Tracking

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to view and manage all my positions across different DEXs in one place, so that I can monitor my portfolio effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN position data is requested THEN the system SHALL fetch and display mock positions from Hyperliquid and Lighter
2. WHEN position data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL show calculated PnL, margin requirements, and liquidation prices
3. WHEN funding rates change THEN the system SHALL update position costs and broadcast updates via WebSocket
4. WHEN a position approaches liquidation THEN the system SHALL send alerts via WebSocket
5. IF a position close is requested THEN the system SHALL simulate routing through the appropriate DEX

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and Analytics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my trading history and analytics, so that I can analyze my performance and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trade is executed THEN the system SHALL store trade details, fees, and execution time in the database
2. WHEN a user requests trade history THEN the system SHALL provide paginated results with filtering options
3. WHEN calculating analytics THEN the system SHALL provide PnL summaries, win rates, and fee analysis across time periods
4. WHEN market data is received THEN the system SHALL store price history for charting and analysis
5. IF the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL cache critical data in Redis and sync when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to handle high concurrent usage and maintain low latency, so that users have a smooth trading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives concurrent requests THEN it SHALL handle at least 1000 simultaneous WebSocket connections
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms for 95% of requests
3. WHEN caching price data THEN the system SHALL use Redis with TTL of 100ms for aggregated prices
4. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN the system SHALL support multiple API server instances with load balancing
5. IF system load exceeds 80% capacity THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per user/IP

### Requirement 7: Security and Risk Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my funds and data to be secure, so that I can trade with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user wallets THEN the system SHALL never store private keys or seed phrases
2. WHEN processing transactions THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs and implement proper sanitization
3. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL limit API calls to 100 per minute per authenticated user
4. WHEN detecting suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL temporarily suspend the account and require re-authentication
5. IF a security breach is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately disable affected accounts and notify administrators

### Requirement 8: Infrastructure and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting, so that I can maintain system reliability and quickly respond to issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL collect metrics on API response times, WebSocket connections, and database performance
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information and send alerts for critical failures
3. WHEN DEX connections fail THEN the system SHALL alert operators within 1 minute
4. WHEN system resources exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger auto-scaling or alert for manual intervention
5. IF any core service becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL maintain graceful degradation and user notifications
